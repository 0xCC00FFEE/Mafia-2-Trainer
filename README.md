# Mafia 2 Trainer

This is a trainer external hack for Mafia 2 game.
This project is shared for educational purposes only, mainly for teaching Reverse Code Engineering/C++ coding, and optimizing games' protection mechanisms.

This project is still far from stable, so please use it on your own risk.

Currently available features:
- Infinite Ammo.
- Infinite Health.

# Notes:
- This is an external hack, which means it's a DLL to be injected in the game's process.
- The current hacks patches the ammo/health decrease instructions in memory on-the-fly, which makes your health and ammo, as well as your enemies health and ammo infinite. (troll?)
